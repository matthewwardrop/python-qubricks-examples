This example models a single triple-quantum-dot (TQD) qubit.

Usage
-----

On a system with python-qubricks and python-parameters installed, one can load the
model in an interactive session using:
-----
$ ipython2

>>> from tqd import TQD
>>> t = TQD('params.py')
-----

If you are interested in investigating how DC and HF charge noise affects
return probabilities of various states, run:
-----
$ python2 noise.py
-----

If you would like to see the spectrum of the TQD system as 
a function of detuning, run:
-----
$ python2 spectrum.py
