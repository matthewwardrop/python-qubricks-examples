This example is based on the paper:
M. P. Wardrop and A. C. Doherty, "Exchange-based two-qubit gate for singlet-triplet qubits", PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 045418 (2014).

Usage
-----

On a system with python-qubricks and python-parameters installed, one can load the
model in an interactive session using:
-----
$ ipython

>>> from dqd import DQD
>>> d = DQD('params.py')
-----

If you are interested in regenerating the plots in the above paper, change
directory to the "plots" folder, and run:
-----
$ python2 fidelity.py <dim> <profile> <operators>
-----
where <dim> is some integer which will correspond to an nxn colour plot, <profile>
is some valid profile such as "sinusoidal", and operators are any extra operators
to add during runtime, such as "J_23_hf".

If you want plots including psuedo-static noise, run:
-----
$ python2 fidelity_noise.py <dim> <profile> <operators>
-----
With the same synyax as before, but where profiles should be specified with the 
addition of "_noisy"; for example "sinusoidal_noisy".
